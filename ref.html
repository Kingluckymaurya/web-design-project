        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
            a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
            such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance.</p>
        <br>
        <p> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as (img) and
            (input) directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
            (p) and (/p) surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers
            do
            not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
        <br>
        <p> HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium
            (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of
            CSS
            over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
            audio, primarily using the (canvas) element, together with JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
            XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
            fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without
            concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
            characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
            .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be
            cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternative formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more
            than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
            predictable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
            type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
            validation service for CSS documents.</p>
        <br>
        <p> In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
            CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language and core technology of the web platform, alongside HTML and CSS.
            Ninety-nine percent of websites on the World Wide Web use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
            behavior.</p>
<br>
           <p>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also
            utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is
            Node.js[citation needed].</p> 
<br>
           <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p> 
<br>
           <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p> 
<br>
           <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ
            greatly in design.</p>
