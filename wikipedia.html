    <h1>Ashoka</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Ashoka, also known as Asoka or Aśoka (/əˈʃoʊkə/[7] ə-SHOH-kə; Sanskrit: [ɐˈɕoːkɐ], IAST: Aśoka; c. 304 – 232
        BCE), and popularly known as Ashoka the Great, was Emperor of Magadha[8] from c. 268 BCE until his death in 232
        BCE, and the third ruler from the Mauryan dynasty. His empire covered a large part of the Indian subcontinent,
        stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to present-day Bangladesh in the east, with its capital at
        Pataliputra. A patron of Buddhism, he is credited with an important role in the spread of Buddhism across
        ancient Asia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Edicts of Ashoka state that during his eighth regnal year (c. 260 BCE), he conquered Kalinga after a brutal
        war. Ashoka subsequently devoted himself to the propagation of "dhamma" or righteous conduct, the major theme of
        the edicts. Ashoka's edicts suggest that a few years after the Kalinga War, he was gradually drawn towards
        Buddhism. The Buddhist legends credit Ashoka with establishing a large number of stupas, patronising the Third
        Buddhist council, supporting Buddhist missionaries, and making generous donations to the sangha.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Ashoka's existence as a historical emperor had almost been forgotten, but since the decipherment in the 19th
        century of sources written in the Brahmi script, Ashoka holds a reputation as one of the greatest Indian
        emperors. The State Emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka.
        Ashoka's wheel, the Ashoka Chakra, is adopted at the centre of the National Flag of India.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Sources of information</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Information about Ashoka comes from his inscriptions, other inscriptions that mention him or are possibly from
        his reign, and ancient literature, especially Buddhist texts.[9] These sources often contradict each other,
        although various historians have attempted to correlate their testimony.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Inscriptions</h3>
    <p>Ashoka's inscriptions are the earliest self-representations of imperial power in the Indian subcontinent.[11]
        However, these inscriptions are focused mainly on the topic of dhamma, and provide little information regarding
        other aspects of the Maurya state or society.[10] Even on the topic of dhamma, the content of these inscriptions
        cannot be taken at face value. In the words of American academic John S. Strong, it is sometimes helpful to
        think of Ashoka's messages as propaganda by a politician whose aim is to present a favourable image of himself
        and his administration, rather than record historical facts.[12]</p>
    <p>
        A small number of other inscriptions also provide some information about Ashoka.[10] For example, he finds a
        mention in the 2nd century Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman.[13] An inscription discovered at Sirkap
        mentions a lost word beginning with "Priyadari", which is theorised to be Ashoka's title "Priyadarshi" since it
        has been written in Aramaic of 3rd century BCE, although this is not certain.[14] Some other inscriptions, such
        as the Sohgaura copper plate inscription and the Mahasthan inscription, have been tentatively dated to Ashoka's
        period by some scholars, although others contest this.[15]</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Buddhist legends</h3>
    <p>Much of the information about Ashoka comes from Buddhist legends, which present him as a great, ideal
        emperor.[16] These legends appear in texts that are not contemporary to Ashoka and were composed by Buddhist
        authors, who used various stories to illustrate the impact of their faith on Ashoka. This makes it necessary to
        exercise caution while relying on them for historical information.[17] Among modern scholars, opinions range
        from downright dismissal of these legends as mythological to acceptance of all historical portions that seem
        plausible.[18]</p>
    <p>
        The Buddhist legends about Ashoka exist in several languages, including Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Chinese,
        Burmese, Khmer, Sinhala, Thai, Lao, and Khotanese. All these legends can be traced to two primary
        traditions:[19]</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>the North Indian tradition preserved in the Sanskrit-language texts such as Divyavadana (including its
            constituent Ashokavadana); and Chinese sources such as A-yü wang chuan and A-yü wang ching.[19]</li>
        <li>the Sri Lankan tradition preserved in Pali-language texts, such as Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa, Vamsatthapakasini
            (a commentary on Mahavamsa), Buddhaghosha's commentary on the Vinaya, and Samanta-pasadika.[13][19]</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>There are several significant differences between the two traditions. For example, the Sri Lankan tradition
        emphasizes Ashoka's role in convening the Third Buddhist council, and his dispatch of several missionaries to
        distant regions, including his son Mahinda to Sri Lanka.[19] However, the North Indian tradition makes no
        mention of these events. It describes other events not found in the Sri Lankan tradition, such as a story about
        another son named Kunala.[20]</p>
    <p>Even while narrating the common stories, the two traditions diverge in several ways. For example, both
        Ashokavadana and Mahavamsa mention that Ashoka's empress Tishyarakshita had the Bodhi Tree destroyed. In
        Ashokavadana, the empress manages to have the tree healed after she realises her mistake. In the Mahavamsa, she
        permanently destroys the tree, but only after a branch of the tree has been transplanted in Sri Lanka.[21] In
        another story, both the texts describe Ashoka's unsuccessful attempts to collect a relic of Gautama Buddha from
        Ramagrama. In Ashokavadana, he fails to do so because he cannot match the devotion of the Nāgas who hold the
        relic; however, in the Mahavamsa, he fails to do so because the Buddha had destined the relic to be enshrined by
        King Dutthagamani of Sri Lanka.[22] Using such stories, the Mahavamsa glorifies Sri Lanka as the new preserve of
        Buddhism.[23]</p>
    <h3>Other sources</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Numismatic, sculptural, and archaeological evidence supplements research on Ashoka.[24] Ashoka's name appears in
        the lists of Mauryan emperors in the various Puranas. However, these texts do not provide further details about
        him, as their Brahmanical authors were not patronised by the Mauryans.[25] Other texts, such as the Arthashastra
        and Indica of Megasthenes, which provide general information about the Maurya period, can also be used to make
        inferences about Ashoka's reign.[26] However, the Arthashastra is a normative text that focuses on an ideal
        rather than a historical state, and its dating to the Mauryan period is a subject of debate. The Indica is a
        lost work, and only parts of it survive in the form of paraphrases in later writings.[10]</p>
    <p>
        The 12th-century text Rajatarangini mentions a Kashmiri king Ashoka of Gonandiya dynasty who built several
        stupas: some scholars, such as Aurel Stein, have identified this king with the Maurya emperor Ashoka; others,
        such as Ananda W. P. Guruge dismiss this identification as inaccurate.[27]</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Alternative interpretation of the epigraphic evidence</h3>
    <br>
    <p>For Christopher I. Beckwith — whose theories are not accepted by mainstream scholarship — Ashoka, whose name only
        appears in the Minor Rock Edicts, is not the same as king Piyadasi, or Devanampiya Piyadasi (i.e. "Beloved of
        the Gods Piyadasi", "Beloved of the Gods" being a fairly widespread title for "King"), who is named as the
        author of the Major Pillar Edicts and the Major Rock Edicts.[28]
    </p>
    <p> Beckwith suggests that Piyadasi was living in the 3rd century BCE, was probably the son of Chandragupta Maurya
        known to the Greeks as Amitrochates, and only advocated for piety ("Dharma") in his Major Pillar Edicts and
        Major Rock Edicts, without ever mentioning Buddhism, the Buddha, or the Sangha (the single notable exception is
        the 7th Edict of the Major Pillar Edicts which does mention the Sangha, but is now considered to have been faked
        by Beckwith).[28] Also, the geographical spread of his inscription shows that Piyadasi ruled a vast Empire,
        contiguous with the Seleucid Empire in the West.[28]
    </p>
    <p> On the contrary, for Beckwith, Ashoka was a later king of the 1st–2nd century CE, whose name only appears
        explicitly in the Minor Rock Edicts and allusively in the Minor Pillar Edicts, and who does mention the Buddha
        and the Sangha, explicitly promoting Buddhism.[28] The name "Priyadarsi" does occur in two of the minor edicts
        (Gujarra and Bairat), but Beckwith again considers them as later fabrications.[28] The minor inscriptions cover
        a very different and much smaller geographical area, clustering in Central India.[28] According to Beckwith, the
        inscriptions of this later Ashoka were typical of the later forms of "normative Buddhism", which are well
        attested from inscriptions and Gandhari manuscripts dated to the turn of the millennium, and around the time of
        the Kushan Empire.[28] The quality of the inscriptions of this Ashoka is significantly lower than the quality of
        the inscriptions of the earlier Piyadasi.[28]
    </p>
    <p> However, many of Beckwith's methodologies and interpretations concerning early Buddhism, inscriptions, and
        archaeological sites have been criticized by other scholars, such as Johannes Bronkhorst and Osmund
        Bopearachchi.[29][30] According to Patrick Olivelle, Beckwith's theory is "an outlier and no mainstream Ashokan
        scholar would subscribe to that view."[31]</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Names and titles</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The name "A-shoka" literally means "without sorrow". According to an Ashokavadana legend, his mother gave him
        this name because his birth removed her sorrows.[32]
    </p>
    <p> The name Priyadasi is associated with Ashoka in the 3rd–4th century CE Dipavamsa.[33][34] The term literally
        means "he who regards amiably", or "of gracious mien" (Sanskrit: Priya-darshi). It may have been a regnal name
        adopted by Ashoka.[35][36] A version of this name is used for Ashoka in Greek-language inscriptions: βασιλεὺς
        Πιοδασσης ("Basileus Piodassēs").[36]
    </p>
    <p> Ashoka's inscriptions mention his title Devanampiya (Sanskrit: Devanampriya, "Beloved of the Gods"). The
        identification of Devanampiya and Ashoka as the same person is established by the Maski and Gujarra
        inscriptions, which use both these terms for the king.[37][38] The title was adopted by other kings, including
        the contemporary king Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura and Ashoka's descendant Dasharatha Maurya.[39]</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Date</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The exact date of Ashoka's birth is not certain, as the extant contemporary Indian texts did not record such
        details. It is known that he lived in the 3rd century BCE, as his inscriptions mention several contemporary
        rulers whose dates are known with more certainty, such as Antiochus II Theos, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, Antigonus
        II Gonatas, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander (of Epirus or Corinth).[40] Thus, Ashoka must have been born sometime
        in the late 4th century BCE or early 3rd century BCE (c. 304 BCE),[41] and ascended the throne around 269-268
        BCE.[40]

    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ancestry</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Ashoka's own inscriptions are fairly detailed but make no mention of his ancestors.[42] Other sources, such as
        the Puranas and the Mahavamsa state that his father was the Mauryan emperor Bindusara, and his grandfather was
        Chandragupta – the founder of the Empire.[43] The Ashokavadana also names his father as Bindusara, but traces
        his ancestry to Buddha's contemporary king Bimbisara, through Ajatashatru, Udayin, Munda, Kakavarnin, Sahalin,
        Tulakuchi, Mahamandala, Prasenajit, and Nanda.[44] The 16th century Tibetan monk Taranatha, whose account is a
        distorted version of the earlier traditions,[26] describes Ashoka as son of king Nemita of Champarana from the
        daughter of a merchant.[45]
    </p>
    <p> Ashokavadana states that Ashoka's mother was the daughter of a Brahmin from Champa, and was prophesied to marry
        a king. Accordingly, her father took her to Pataliputra, where she became Bindusara's chief empress.[46] The
        Ashokavadana does not mention her by name,[47] although other legends provide different names for her.[48] For
        example, the Asokavadanamala calls her Subhadrangi.[49][50] The Vamsatthapakasini or Mahavamsa-tika, a
        commentary on Mahavamsa, calls her "Dharma" ("Dhamma" in Pali), and states that she belonged to the Moriya
        Kshatriya clan.[50] A Divyavadana legend calls her Janapada-kalyani;[51] according to scholar Ananda W. P.
        Guruge, this is not a name, but an epithet.[49]
    </p>
    <p> According to the 2nd-century historian Appian, Chandragupta entered into a marital alliance with the Greek ruler
        Seleucus I Nicator, which has led to speculation that either Chandragupta or his son Bindusara married a Greek
        princess. However, there is no evidence that Ashoka's mother or grandmother was Greek, and most historians have
        dismissed the idea.[52]</p>
    <br>
    <h2>As a prince</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Ashoka's own inscriptions do not describe his early life, and much of the information on this topic comes from
        apocryphal legends written hundreds of years after him.[53] While these legends include obviously fictitious
        details such as narratives of Ashoka's past lives, they have some plausible historical information about
        Ashoka's period.[53][51]
    </p>
    <p> According to the Ashokavadana, when Ashoka was young, his father hated him for his rough and unappealing skin.
        One day, Bindusara, his father, asked the ascetic Pingala-vatsajiva to determine which of his sons was worthy of
        being his successor. He asked all the princes to assemble at the Garden of the Golden Pavilion on the ascetic's
        advice. Ashoka was reluctant to go because his father disliked him, but his mother convinced him to do so. When
        minister Radhagupta saw Ashoka leaving the capital for the Garden, he offered to provide the prince with an
        imperial elephant for the travel.[54] At the Garden, Pingala-vatsajiva examined the princes and realised that
        Ashoka would be the next emperor. To avoid annoying Bindusara, the ascetic refused to name the successor.
        Instead, he said that one who had the best mount, seat, drink, vessel and food would be the next king; each
        time, Ashoka declared that he met the criterion. Later, he told Ashoka's mother that her son would be the next
        emperor, and on her advice, left the empire to avoid Bindusara's wrath.[55]
    </p>
    <p> While legends suggest that Bindusara disliked Ashoka's ugly appearance, they also state that Bindusara gave him
        important responsibilities, such as suppressing a revolt in Takshashila (according to north Indian tradition)
        and governing Ujjain (according to Sri Lankan tradition). This suggests that Bindusara was impressed by the
        other qualities of the prince.[56] Another possibility is that he sent Ashoka to distant regions to keep him
        away from the imperial capital.[57]</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Rebellion at Taxila</h3>
    <br>
    <p>According to the Ashokavadana, Bindusara dispatched prince Ashoka to suppress a rebellion in the city of
        Takshashila[58] (present-day Bhir Mound[59] in Pakistan). This episode is not mentioned in the Sri Lankan
        tradition, which instead states that Bindusara sent Ashoka to govern Ujjain. Two other Buddhist texts –
        Ashoka-sutra and Kunala-sutra – state that Bindusara appointed Ashoka as a viceroy in Gandhara (where
        Takshashila was located), not Ujjain.[56]
    </p>
    <p> The Ashokavadana states that Bindusara provided Ashoka with a fourfold-army (comprising cavalry, elephants,
        chariots and infantry) but refused to provide any weapons for this army. Ashoka declared that weapons would
        appear before him if he was worthy of being an emperor, and then, the deities emerged from the earth and
        provided weapons to the army. When Ashoka reached Takshashila, the citizens welcomed him and told him that their
        rebellion was only against the evil ministers, not the emperor. Sometime later, Ashoka was similarly welcomed in
        the Khasa territory and the gods declared that he would go on to conquer the whole earth.[58]
    </p>
    <p> Takshashila was a prosperous and geopolitically influential city, and historical evidence proves that by
        Ashoka's time, it was well-connected to the Mauryan capital Pataliputra by the Uttarapatha trade route.[60]
        However, no extant contemporary source mentions the Takshashila rebellion, and none of Ashoka's records states
        that he ever visited the city.[61] That said, the historicity of the legend about Ashoka's involvement in the
        Takshashila rebellion may be corroborated by an Aramaic-language inscription discovered at Sirkap near Taxila.
        The inscription includes a name that begins with the letters "prydr", and most scholars restore it as
        "Priyadarshi", which was the title of Ashoka.[56] Another evidence of Ashoka's connection to the city may be the
        name of the Dharmarajika Stupa near Taxila; the name suggests that it was built by Ashoka ("Dharma-raja").[62]
    </p>
    <p> The story about the deities miraculously bringing weapons to Ashoka may be the text's way of deifying Ashoka; or
        indicating that Bindusara – who disliked Ashoka – wanted him to fail in Takshashila.[63]</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Viceroy of Ujjain</h3>
    <br>
    <p>According to the Mahavamsa, Bindusara appointed Ashoka as the Viceroy of Avantirastra (present day Ujjain
        district),[56] which was an important administrative and commercial province in central India.[64] This
        tradition is corroborated by the Saru Maru inscription discovered in central India; this inscription states that
        he visited the place as a prince.[65] Ashoka's own rock edict mentions the presence of a prince viceroy at
        Ujjain during his reign,[66] which further supports the tradition that he himself served as a viceroy at
        Ujjain.[67]</p>


      <p>  The Saru Maru commemorative inscription seems to mention the presence of Ashoka in the area of Ujjain as he was
        still a Prince.</p>
    <p>   Pataliputra was connected to Ujjain by multiple routes in Ashoka's time, and on the way, Ashoka entourage may
        have encamped at Rupnath, where his inscription has been found.[68]
</p> 
       <p> According to the Sri Lankan tradition, Ashoka visited Vidisha, where he fell in love with a beautiful woman on
        his way to Ujjain. According to the Dipamvamsa and Mahamvamsa, the woman was Devi – the daughter of a merchant.
        According to the Mahabodhi-vamsa, she was Vidisha-Mahadevi and belonged to the Shakya clan of Gautama Buddha.
        The Buddhist chroniclers may have fabricated the Shakya connection to connect Ashoka's family to Buddha.[69] The
        Buddhist texts allude to her being a Buddhist in her later years but do not describe her conversion to Buddhism.
        Therefore, it is likely that she was already a Buddhist when she met Ashoka.[70]
</p>
       <p>
        The Mahavamsa states that Devi gave birth to Ashoka's son Mahinda in Ujjain, and two years later, to a daughter
        named Sanghamitta.[71] According to the Mahavamsa, Ashoka's son Mahinda was ordained at the age of 20 years,
        during the sixth year of Ashoka's reign. That means Mahinda must have been 14 years old when Ashoka ascended the
        throne. Even if Mahinda was born when Ashoka was as young as 20 years old, Ashoka must have ascended the throne
        at 34 years, which means he must have served as a viceroy for several years.[72]</p>
